# About

Public transit is important to daily life, especially in major cities. How does the development of [public transit](https://tilliefreed2028.github.io/Tillie-s-Practice-Canopy-/works/new-york-broadway-plaza-proposed-pedestrian-transi.html) impact people within these communities? What are the benefits? What are the drawbacks? 

## Overview

WOW THIS IS SO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!

## Sigma Test Visualization

<div id="sigma-container" style="width:600px;height:400px;border:1px solid #ccc;"></div>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/sigma@2/build/sigma.min.js"></script>

<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  const container = document.getElementById("sigma-container");

  if (!container || typeof sigma === "undefined") {
    console.log("Sigma failed to load");
    return;
  }

  const graph = {
    nodes: [
      { id: "n0", label: "Node 1", x: 0, y: 0, size: 10, color: "#ff0000" },
      { id: "n1", label: "Node 2", x: 1, y: 1, size: 10, color: "#0000ff" }
    ],
    edges: [
      { id: "e0", source: "n0", target: "n1" }
    ]
  };

  new sigma.Sigma(graph, container);
});
</script>

- _30 manifests_ of manuscripts from **Collection A**;
- _15 manifests_ of portraits from **Collection B**;
- and _5 manifests_ of scrapbooks sourced **directly** and not part of structured collection.

A team is tasked with building out a unified digital project for these items that allows users to browse their content, as well as interact with contextual essays, timelines, and maps. By using Canopy, implementers can quickly stand-up a working project with every manifest becoming its own work page, authored Markdown files providing context, and both streams feeding a shared search index before everything is written out to static HTML, CSS, and data assets.

## Colophon

Canopy was created by [Mat Jordan](https://github.com/mathewjordan) _(Northwestern University)_ and [Mark Baggett](https://github.com/markpbaggett) _(Texas A&M University)_ as a method to quickly build exhibit style digital humanities projects that extend existing digital collections using IIIF Collections and Manifests. It continues to be an active open-source initiative of [Northwestern University Libraries](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/), where it supports digital scholarship in many forms. This example site is built from the [Donald K. Adams and Lawrence D. Stewart Collection of Prints](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/94536627-cfdf-413c-852b-0cb16d986da3) and the [Indian Paintings on Mica](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/7ac5769f-a1d9-4227-a350-bf8bd8b1cddc) collection hosted by Northwestern University Libraries' [Digital Collections](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/).

Canopy uses the [IIIF Presentation API](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) to deliver rich media from providing institutions, [Markdown as MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for authoring contextual content and layout, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the user interface, and a static [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) index for search. Easy aggregation and retrieval of IIIF resources is made possible by the [IIIF helpers](https://github.com/IIIF-Commons/iiif-helpers) developed by [Stephen Fraser](https://github.com/stephenwf). In addition, [Clover IIIF](https://github.com/samvera-labs/clover-iiif), developed by Northwestern University Libraries with contributions from other institutions, is integral to Canopy and provides the rendering of IIIF resources, annotations, and metadata throughout the interface.
