# Canopy Starter Template

This repository offers a pared-down starting point for new Canopy IIIF sites. When you need deeper documentation, examples, or release notes, head over to the main project at https://github.com/canopy-iiif/app.

## Updates

Keep the starter current by running `npm install @canopy-iiif/app@latest` whenever a new release ships, or trigger the `Update Canopy App` GitHub Action (Actions tab → *Update Canopy App* → *Run workflow*) and let it open a pull request with the dependency bump for you.

## Getting Started

Point `canopy.yml` at your preferred IIIF collection, add pages and layouts under `content/`, and walk through the getting started guide at https://canopy-iiif.github.io/docs/getting-started/ for a full tour.

## Contributing

All development happens in https://github.com/canopy-iiif/app. If you are interested in shaping Canopy IIIF, please open an issue, share feedback, or send a pull request.
